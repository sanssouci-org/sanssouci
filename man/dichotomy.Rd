\title{For a given risk level, calibrate the method on learned templates by
dichotomy. This is equivalent to calibrating using pivotal stats but does
not require the availability of a closed form inverse template.}
\usage{
dichotomy(alpha, learned_templates, pval0, k_max, min_dist = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{A float, confidence level in [0, 1]}

\item{learned_templates}{A matrix with m rows and B columns. Learned templates for B permutations and m features}

\item{pval0}{A matrix with m rows and B columns of permuted p-values.}

\item{k_max}{An integer value, the template size.}

\item{min_dist}{An integer, minimum distance to stop iterating dichotomy. Defaults to \code{m}}
}
\value{
A vector of length k_max. Threshold family chosen by calibration
}
\description{
For a given risk level, calibrate the method on learned templates by
dichotomy. This is equivalent to calibrating using pivotal stats but does
not require the availability of a closed form inverse template.
