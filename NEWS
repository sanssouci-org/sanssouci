SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

Version 0.8.0 [2019-03-27]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

* calibrateJER() gained argument rowTestFUN in order to perform other
  tests than the classical Welch (Student-T) test, in the two-sample
  case. 

* Added rowBinomialTests() for vectorized Binomial tests, and corresponding 
  tests scripts. Note that two-sided Binomial tests are in fact not vecorized 
  yet.
  
* Added rowWilcoxonTests() for vectorized Wilcoxon rank sum tests, and 
  corresponding tests scripts. Removed wilcoxStats() which had become 
  redundant, and simulateMein() which was using it and which was not being 
  used. 

* BUG FIG in rowWilcoxonTests(): ties were not handled the same way	as in
  wilcox.test() because the default of matrixStats::rowRanks(ties = "max")
  is not the same as the default of rank(ties = "average"). Now also
  *rounding* the ranks in order to make use of matrixStats::rowTabulates(),
  which itself only works with	integer	values.
   
SOFTWARE QUALITY:

* Added more tests for the "direction" of the lambda-calibration in 
  calibrateJER().

DEPRECATION & DEFUNCT:

* testByRandomization() does not return 'df' and 'df0' anymore as these were
  unused idiosyncrasies of t-tests (e.g. not relevant for Wilcoxon tests).

MISC

* Renamed NEWS.md to NEWS and reformatted for news(package = "sansSouci") to 
  become informative.

* calibrateJER() gained argument 'maxStepsDown' to control the maximal number 
  of steps down.

* In calibrateJER0() suppressed the warning occurring when the maximal number 
  of steps down is reached without convergence.


Version 0.7.0 [2018-06-19]

* Added "tree" functions (and simulation scripts) from DBNR 2018.
* Added vignette confidenceEnvelopes_localized to illustrate DBNR 2018.

* Added support for one-sided tests in 'calibrateJER' and 'testByRandomization' (this feature has been imported from the branch generic-randomization-tests). Added corresponding tests.

* Cleanups in 'testByRandomization': "parametric" p-values are now the default, randomization p-values are not computed by default. Note that permutation test statistics are not mapped to the one-sided N(0,1) scale under the null (this is done by calibrateJER). 

* Updated vignettes.

Version 0.6.0 [2018-03-26]

* Added vignette 'jointErrorRateCalibration_simulations.Rmd'.

* Added function maxFP and minTP to calculate post hoc bound among user-defined selections. Renamed function 'upperBoundFP' to 'curveMaxFP' for internal consistency. Removed functions 'falseDiscoveryEnvelope', 'falseDiscoveryProportionControl' and 'falseDiscoveryProportionEnvelope' which provided correct but conservative bounds. 

* Added function 'calibrateJER' as the main user-level entry point for calibrating JER thresholds. Renamed 'jointFWERControl' into 'calibrateJER0', which is not exported anymore. (Fixes #7). 

* Cleanup: user-level entry point for simulating test statistics is now 'gaussianTestStatistics'.

* Cleanup: user-level entry point for simulating observations from one and two-sample problems is now 'gaussianSamples'.

* Added corresponding tests and updated vignettes accordingly.

* Cleanups in 'inst' scripts.

* Cleanup: *many* lower-level functions are not exported anymore; their documentation is still available in the form of comments but not as .Rd files. 

* Some code cleanups (spacing; comments)

Version 0.5.1 [2018-02-07]

* Added data/volcano.rda with p-values and fold changes for 4 public gene expression data sets.

  (as nicely suggested by a referee).

* Added travis CI and appveyor support.

Version 0.4.10 [2017-01-27]

* Added tiny test for numerical reproducibility of JR control function.

Version 0.4.9 [2017-01-10]

* Moved to github
* Passes R CMD check locally

Version 0.4.8 [2016-08-11]

* Reshaped the scripts of the numerical experiments or the BNR paper.

Version 0.4.7 [2016-07-04]

* In 'upperBoundFP', implemented the case 'kMax<m' for all flavors. Added corresponding 'testthat' scripts.

Version 0.4.6 [2016-06-17]

* Added linearly decreasing SNR to BNR test scripts.
* Added 'simulateToeplitz' to simulate under Gaussian distribution
  with Toeplitz covariance matrix.

Version 0.4.5 [2016-06-16]

* Added alternative (finer?) definition of power to BNR test scripts.

Version 0.4.4 [2016-06-10]

* BUG fix in 'pivotatStat' (cont'd): the pivotal statistic was not
  calculated properly for kFWER threshold family when the cardinal of
  the set of candidate hypotheses ($\cC$) was less than m.
* Added a test script to check that the R and C++ versions of
  'minPseudoRanks' give identical results.

Version 0.4.3 [2016-06-09]

* BUG fix in 'pivotatStat' (cont'd): the pivotal statistic was not
  calculated properly for kFWER threshold family when the cardinal of
  the set of candidate hypotheses ($\cC$) was less than m.
* Removed function 'pivotalStat' as the calculation of kFWER and Simes
  statistics now have almost nothing to share.

Version 0.4.2 [2016-06-09]

* BUG fix in 'pivotatStat': the pivotal statistic was not calculated
  properly for Simes' threshold family when the cardinal of the set of
  candidate hypotheses ($\cC$) was less than m.
* removed 'jointFWERThresholdCalibration' to make the code in 'jointFWERControl' more explicit.

Version 0.4.1 [2016-06-07]

* BUG fix in 'jointFWERControl': the threshold family was not
  updated properly throughout the step-down process.

Version 0.4.0 [2016-06-06]

Another major change in the package interface:
* added functions 'SimesPivotalStatistic', 'jointFWERThresholdCalibration', 'kFWERPivotalStatistic'.
* the main user-level entry function is now 'jointFWERControl', which performs step-down JFWER control by default.

Version 0.3.2

* continuing the transition from inlienedocs to roxygen2 for package documentation.

Version 0.3.1 [2016-06-02]

* BUG FIX in 'stepDownJointFWERControl': in some rare situations the algorithm could be stuck alternating between two candidate rejection sets R1, hence never terminating. Now forcing the 'best' candidate (ie the largest one) to be selected.
* Added a test (using 'extdata/simTrace.rda') to make sure that 'stepDownJointFWERControl' terminates in such situations.

Version: 0.3.0 [2016-06-02]

Major rewriting of the code for increased clarity and efficiency:

* Renamed and reshaped the functions to calibrate JFWER thresholds (step down and single step).

* Dropped dichotomy in favor of pivotal statistic for the computation of JFWER thresholds.

* Speedup in 'upperBoundFP'.

* Added 'SimesThresholdFamily', 'pivotalStat', 'thresholdFamily', 'kFWERThresholdFamily', 'partialColSortDesc', 'biSort'.

* Added test scripts (using package "testthat").

* Moved from "inlinedocs" to "roxygen2" for documentation (mostly because documenting Rcpp functions is easier and the nice integration with other (dev)tools for checking package, running examples and performing package tests).

Version: 0.2.3 [2016-05-06]

* BUG FIX: in 'getJointFWERThresholds', function 'refFamily' could
  return a matrix of dimensions m x 0 instead of a vector of length m.

Version: 0.2.2 [2016-04-20]

* Updated examples to pass R CMD check without ERROR.

* 'stepDownControl' vignette now in .Rmd.

Version: 0.2.1 [2016-02-04]

* Fixed NAMESPACE for calling Rcpp.

Version: 0.2.0 [2016-02-02]

* SPEEDUP: 'getJointFWERThresholds' now calls Rcpp functions for time costly operations (sorting).

* Fixed some typos in the documentation.

Version: 0.1.3 [2016-01-28]

* BUG FIX: the one-parameter family should not be updated at each step down!

* Example fixed accordingly.

* Changed names of input and return values of 'getJointFWERThresholds' for consistency with the notation of the BNR paper.

* Added test script for unbalancedness.

Version: 0.1.2 [2016-01-07]

* Implemented the "Oracle" version of step-down control.

Version: 0.1.1 [2015-12-17]

* added scripts to test step-down JFWER control

Version: 0.1.0 [2015-12-10]

* Tentative implementation of Etienne's trick to avoid dichotomy in 'getJointFWERThresholds'. Quite slow for kFWER thresholds.
